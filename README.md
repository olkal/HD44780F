# HD44780F
Simple and fast HD44780 LCD driver, with reading of D7 for BUSY flag status. Can also be used with fixed BUSY time delay if RW pin is not connected. Originaly intended for 16mhz AVR's and direct port manipulation for reading/writing to the LCD. I'm currently using this code as it is, but be aware that not all the functions for HD44780 are implemented.
